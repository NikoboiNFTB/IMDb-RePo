## üõ† Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**  
   Recommended: Firefox + Tampermonkey  
   - [Tampermonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)  
   - [Tampermonkey (Chromium)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  
   *(Violentmonkey and Greasemonkey may work, but aren‚Äôt officially supported.)*

2. **Install the Script**  
   - Click [here](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/IMDb-RePo-6.0.user.js) and install when prompted.
   - Your userscript manager should prompt for installation.  
   - Or download the `.user.js` file manually and import it.

3. **Alternatively; Automatic Redirect Edition**  
   For automatic redirect to streaming site: Click [here](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/IMDb-AutoRePo-6.0.user.js)
     - Not recommended for watching a specific episode of a series, or in general, really.

5. **Recommended 111Movies Tweaks**  

   - [`Remove Player Gradient`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111Movies-Gradient-1.0.user.js)  
     Removes the persistent shadow overlay on the player.  

   - [`Hide Server`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111Movies-Server-1.1.user.js)  
     Hides the server button along with the rest of the Player UI.

   - [`Hide Cursor`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111Movies-Cursor-1.1.user.js)  
     Hides the cursor with the rest of the Player GUI when not hovering over player controls.  
     - Brute force, but works. Contributions for a more elegant solution are welcome.

   - [`Add Page Title`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111Movies-Title-1.0.user.js)  
     Add a page title based on IMDb ID.
     - For example, the title `South Park (TV Series 1997‚Äì ) - IMDb` becomes `South Park (TV Series 1997‚Äì ) - 111Movies`.

   - [`Add Page Favicon`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111Movies-Favicon-1.0.user.js)  
     Fetches the 111Movies logo from [`https://111movies.com/assets/img/logo.png`](https://111movies.com/assets/img/logo.png)

6. **Done. Enjoy.**

> **Chrome / Edge / Brave Users:**  
> Make sure Tampermonkey can actually *run* userscripts:  
> - Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or equivalent)  
> - Click **Details** under Tampermonkey  
> - Enable **‚ÄúAllow access to file URLs‚Äù**, **‚ÄúAllow User Scripts‚Äù** and **"Developer Mode"**, then hit **"Update"**
>   - Yes, this is annoying.
>   - Yes, it's Chromium's fault.
>   - No, I can't fix this. 
> - Re-open the IMDb tab. Reloading wasn't enough in my testing.
