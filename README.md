## üõ† Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**  
   Recommended: Firefox + Tampermonkey  
   - [Tampermonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)  
   - [Tampermonkey (Chromium)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  
   *(Violentmonkey and Greasemonkey may work, but aren‚Äôt officially supported.)*

2. **Install the Script**  
   - Click **Raw** on [`IMDb RePo 6.0 - Simple and Fast Redirect Portal.user.js`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/IMDb%20RePo%206.0%20-%20Simple%20and%20Fast%20Redirect%20Portal.user.js)  
   - Your userscript manager should prompt for installation.  
   - Or download the `.user.js` file manually and import it.

3. **Alternatively; Automatic Redirect Edition**  
   For automatic redirect to streaming site: [`IMDb AutoRePo 6.0 - IMDb RePo, Automatic Redirect Edition`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/IMDb%20AutoRePo%206.0%20-%20IMDb%20RePo%2C%20Automatic%20Redirect%20Edition.user.js)
     - not recommended for watching a specific episode of a series.

5. **Recommended 111Movies Tweaks**  

   - [`111Movies - Fetch Title`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/111Movies%20-%20Fetch%20Title%201.0.user.js)  
     Fetches the proper title from IMDb and updates the browser tab.  

   - [`111Movies - Hide Cursor`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/111Movies%20-%20Hide%20Cursor%201.0.user.js)  
     Removes the persistent shadow overlay on the player.  

   - [`111Movies - Hide Server`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/111Movies%20-%20Hide%20Server%201.1.user.js)  
     Dynamically hides the server button along with the player controls.  

   - [`111Movies - Remove Gradient`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/111Movies%20-%20Remove%20Gradient%201.0.user.js)  
     Hides the cursor when not hovering over player controls.  
     - Brute force, but works. Contributions for a more elegant solution are welcome.

   - [`111Movies - Add Favicon`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/blob/main/111Movies%20-%20Remove%20Gradient%201.0.user.js)
     - Similarly to `111Movies - Fetch Title`, this fetches the 111Movies logo and adds it as Favicon.

6. **Done. Enjoy.**

> **Chrome / Edge / Brave Users:**  
> Make sure Tampermonkey can actually *run* userscripts:  
> - Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or equivalent)  
> - Click **Details** under Tampermonkey  
> - Enable **‚ÄúAllow access to file URLs‚Äù**, **‚ÄúAllow User Scripts‚Äù** and **"Developer Mode"**, then hit **"Update"**
>   - Yes, this is annoying.
>   - Yes, it's Chromium's fault.
>   - No, I can't fix this. 
> - Re-open the IMDb tab. Reloading wasn't enough in my testing.
